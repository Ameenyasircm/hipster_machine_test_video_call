The  app allows a new user to register with their name, phone number, email, and password. Once registered, the user can log in using their credentials. After login, the app fetches and displays a list of sample users from an API. A floating action button is available for initiating a video call. When the user taps the button, all registered members are shown, and the logged-in user can select any member to start a one-to-one video call. The video call screen shows both the local camera stream and the remote participantâ€™s video, with options to mute/unmute audio and enable/disable video during the call.
